# Project: 10Academy Week 0 Challenge

## Overview
This is the MCP Setup Challenge for 10Academy TRP. The goal is to configure a modern AI-assisted coding environment and document the learning process.

## Tech Stack
- IDE: Claude Code (CLI)
- MCP Server: tenxfeedbackanalytics (connected)
- Platform: Linux

## Commands
```bash
# Git operations
git status
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master

# Check MCP status
/mcp
```

## Code Style
- Write clear, concise code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment only when logic isn't self-evident
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones

## Workflow Rules
1. **Plan before coding** - For non-trivial tasks, discuss approach first
2. **Verify work** - Always test/validate before marking complete
3. **Small commits** - Commit logical chunks, not massive changes
4. **Ask when unclear** - Better to clarify than assume

## Do NOT
- Don't make changes without reading the file first
- Don't add features beyond what's asked
- Don't skip verification steps
- Don't commit without reviewing changes
